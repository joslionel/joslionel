- 👋 Hi, I’m @joslionel

I'm a full-time cheesemaker, even fuller-time parent, and sometime mine explorer. I love tinkering away at new projects and have a cupboard full of
hobbies I like to get out occasionally.

I lift weights (180kg 100kg 200kg SBD PB), keep bees, and grow veg.

- 👀 I’m interested in ...

I am learning to code because I enjoy a challenge. I like building websites (although design is definitely not my strong suit) and like trying to
automate tasks I do regularly. I'd like to get a job in tech, although I'd rather be a firefighter!

- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...

I'm going through the Odin Project (you can probably tell) and learning JavaScript. I've done a bit of Python and PHP and I'm conversant with MySQL.

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...

Don't, you won't like what you find.
